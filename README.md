# Email_Spam_Classification
Email Spam Classification

This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using a labeled dataset. The workflow includes preprocessing email text data, extracting important features, training a classifier, and evaluating its performance.

Key Features

* Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
* Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer
* Model training with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM
* Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Tech Stack

* Python
* NLTK / Scikit-learn / SpaCy
* Pandas, NumPy

Output

* Spam or not spam prediction for emails
* Detailed classification metrics for model performance
